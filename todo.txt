Solid IDs must be unique (assumed to be all Solids in file)
Side IDs must be unique
    "The id values should be unique even between solids"
Entity IDs must be a unique number among other entity ids. (including world [id = 1])

Requirements for 1.0 release - Little user input required after stage generation
    Let a user choose a file directory containing vmf files
    Each vmf file follows a list of Requirements
        the file is uniquely named
        each named entity follows the format "filename_namedentity"
            for instance a map named 'jump' with an teleport destination entity named 'checkpoint01'
                must instead name the entity 'jump_checkpoint01'
        the map is connected
        the map contains no spawns
        the map contains a starting info_teleport_destination uniquely named "filename_start"
        the map contains an ending teleport entity generically named 'exit'
        the map contains a skip brush tied to an entity generically named 'bounds'
            this entity must encompass the entire map
    Let a user choose how many stages their map should be
    (optional) Let a user choose a starting room stage
    (optional) Let a user choose a final room stage
    Choose stages at random and set the exit teleport destination of the preceding stage
        to 'currentStage_start'
    Set the teleport destination of the spawn room to 'firstStage_start'
    Finally: Set the last stage Exit teleport name to 'final'
        So that the user can easily find the end of the map

Seamless Requirements 1.0 - Some user input required after stage generation
    Choose file directory
        each map in file dir
            must have info_null named 'entry' and 'exit' following template
            let user choose segment Count
            each map the same transition piece
        generate stage
        user adds intro/out


###IMPORTANT###
info_teleport_destination - names must be unique in output map
    along with accompanying 'remote destinations'
    --> This should be doable with a look an replace script
