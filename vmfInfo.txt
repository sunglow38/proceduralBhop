"It is possible to define multiple world Classes, but Hammer will condense them into one single definition, adding the solids and groups of the additional world classes into the first, and using the "latest" properties; that is, if the first world has ("A" "1") and ("B" "2") but the second world only has ("B" "3"),
the new world will have ("A" "1") and ("B" "3")."

On KeyValue 'id':
    Worlds: A unique value among other world Class ids.
    Solids: A unique value among other solids' IDs, Identical values will cause weird minor errors
    Sides: A unique value among other sides ids. Identical values will cause weird minor errors.
    Entities: This is a unique number among other entity ids.

"The BSP file name must not exceed 30 characters, with the ".bsp" extension included"

You can use include statements in keyvalues scripts to include other text files.
    #include "file path"
or
    #base "file path"

Bug:
    "It appears that the #include statement does not work. The #base statement does work, and actually acts as you would expect from a typical include command: it reads the file and creates the controls as children of the panel that called the include statement."
